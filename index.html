        <p class="lead mb-4">As of now, I am currently studying at the University of California, Riverside, as an undergraduate student. While my major remains undeclared, I have a strong interest in pursuing a transfer to the field of graphic design. With my creative mindset and passion for visual arts, I believe that graphic design offers the perfect avenue for me to channel my artistic abilities and make a meaningful impact in the world.

          Choosing a major can be a daunting task, as it sets the foundation for one's academic and professional journey. However, I have always been drawn to the realm of art and design. From a young age, I found myself captivated by the power of visual communication and the ability to convey messages and emotions through imagery. Throughout high school, I took various art courses and participated in extracurricular activities that allowed me to explore different artistic mediums, further fueling my desire to pursue a career in the creative industry.

          During my time at the University of California, Riverside, I have taken advantage of the diverse academic offerings and extracurricular opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. I have engaged in courses that delve into various artistic disciplines, including drawing, painting, and digital design. These experiences have not only enhanced my technical abilities but also broadened my perspective on the vast possibilities within the field of graphic design.
          <br><br>

          Moreover, I have actively sought opportunities to apply my creative skills outside the classroom. I have collaborated with student organizations, participating in designing posters, logos, and promotional materials for events and initiatives. These hands-on experiences have allowed me to witness the impact of design in real-world scenarios, further solidifying my passion for graphic design.

          Looking ahead, my future plans revolve around honing my skills and gaining practical experience in the field. I aim to secure internships or part-time positions at design studios or creative agencies, where I can immerse myself in real-world projects and learn from industry professionals. By doing so, I hope to gain invaluable insights into the industry's best practices, develop a versatile skill set, and build a strong professional network.

          <br><br>

          Additionally, I plan to take advantage of the resources and opportunities offered by my university. I intend to engage with professors and seek mentorship from experienced designers to further refine my craft. Furthermore, I aim to participate in design competitions and attend workshops and conferences to stay updated with the latest trends and techniques in the field.

          One of my long-term goals in graphic design is to establish my own design studio or freelance practice. I aspire to create a platform where I can utilize my skills to collaborate with clients and bring their visions to life. I envision myself working on diverse projects, ranging from branding and marketing campaigns to web design and illustration. I am excited about the prospect of making a positive impact through design and contributing to the visual landscape of various industries.

          In conclusion, while my major is currently undeclared, my passion for graphic design drives me towards pursuing this field. With a strong foundation in art and a desire to make a difference through visual communication, I am committed to developing my skills, gaining practical experience, and ultimately establishing myself as a professional graphic designer. The University of California, Riverside, provides me with the necessary resources and opportunities to achieve these goals, and I am determined to make the most of my time here. Through dedication, perseverance, and continuous learning, I am confident that I can build a successful and fulfilling career in graphic design.
